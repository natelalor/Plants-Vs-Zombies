# Plants vs. Zombies
#### CS205 Final Project (Team 2)


### Game Overview
We set out to create a game similar to the popular game back in the day, Plants Vs. Zombies. 
Using your different types of plants, you set up your defenses and stop the army of zombies coming
at you. If they get passed your defenses, you lose!


### System Overview
We created this game from the ground up using Python and the Python Arcade library. 


### Running Instructions
Navigate yourself to our main.py and run that file. Everything else will be taken care of. Good luck against the zombie hordes!


### Conclusion
This was a 4 developer project with lots to do in a pretty short amount of time. We love how it came out, 
** what could have been better if we had more time ** things
we didn't have time to add ** any errors we have at the end ** etc
